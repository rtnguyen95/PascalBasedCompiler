c = (a * a) + b; ! precedence test , order of isntruction between this statement and the next statement should be different !
c = a * (a + b); ! precedence test !

e = c;
e = a;
b = e;


x = y;
!y = (y / y) / x - 1;! ! This shouldn't work because x, y are bools and 1 is an int !

y = (y / y) / x;

a = b - c - e;



integer1 = integer1 * (integer1 - integer1 * (integer2 / integer1));


! Note to self: Each pop represent the end of an assignment so you are essentially at a new line of coode after a pop!
