Follow the instructions below on building and running tests:

# Build
sh ./build.sh

# Run with a test file as the first argument
./tokenizer tests/declarations.txt

The output to the screen will be the tokens and productions as they are being processed followed by a represenation of the parse tree that shows a token, followed by the productions that were used.

```
-------Parse Tree Productions -----------
KEYWORD     = float
     <Program>
     <StatementList> -> <Statement> <MoreStatements>
     <Statement> -> <Assign> | <Declaration>
     <Declaration> -> <Type><ID>
     <Type> -> float | int | bool
IDENTIFIER  = fahr
     <ID> -> identifier
SEPARATOR   = ;
     <MoreStatements> -> ; <Statement> <MoreStatements> | epsilon
```

Several files are generated in the same folder as the test file that will be named: `<testfile>-<type>.txt` where type is one of the following.

1. states - All of the state transitions from the lexical scanner
2. symbols - A list of all the defined symbols (identifiers in the code) with type and name with the location in the file where they were defined.
3. code - A view of the parse tree that only shows the terminal nodes (leaves) that will look like the source code with comments removed and different spacing.
4. productions - The view of the parse tree that lists tokens and then the productions used to verify the syntax
5. parse tree - A view of the parse tree that will show indented nodes for children.  This shows terminal and non-terminal nodes.

# Demonstration of Features

## Assignments and Declaratives
This shows that the syntax analyzer can handle statements that involve declarations, assignment and arthmetic expressions including identifers and numbers.
```
./tokenizer tests/declarations.txt
```

or a comprehensive test can be run with: 

```
sh tests2.sh
```
This command will run several tests and only report the errors to the screen.  Some source files should have errors to demonstrate error handling.

## While Loop
This example has a while loop inside of a while loop.
```
./tokenizer tests/while.txt
```

## Error handling:
The syntax analyzer stops at the first error.

### Invalid Lexeme:
```
./tokenizer tests/lexicalerror.txt
```
Output includes: 
```
Lexical: tests/lexicalerror.txt:2:5 - _ is only allowed inside of an identifier: _invalid_name
```
### Undefined Symbols:
This will show what happens when an indentifier is used that was not previously defined:
```
./tokenizer tests/undefined.txt 
```
The output includes:
```
Syntactic:  tests/undefined.txt:5:4 - sum was not previously defined
```
Syntax Error:
In this example a while loop is missing the do keyword:
```
./tokenizer tests/syntaxerror.txt
```
In this case the error refers to `while` and a production is not satisfied, though it doesn't give the exact cause.
```
Syntactic:  tests/syntaxerror.txt:4:6 - this rule <TermPrime> -> *<Factor><TermPrime> | /<Factor><TermPrime> | epsilon could not be met with 'while'
```
