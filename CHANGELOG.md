# changes 2/28 (Sean)

parseinput() now takes a parameter parseinput(string) the string is the output destination

tester.cpp reads the input as a command line argument, but now adds "_output.txt" to the end of that.  if you gave  ./tester.out file.txt
it opens file.txt, runs, then the output is in file_output.txt

the else statement was removed in the beginning of our FSM loop (before the switch case)

'#' was added in char_to_col
